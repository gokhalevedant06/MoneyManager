        <h1 >RECURRING DEPOSIT</h1>
        
        <p class="main">
            One of the most popular schemes amongst other post office saving schemes is the post office recurring deposit ( post office RD).
            We have to deposit money here in installments of every month, yearly etc.
            When the recurring deposit account is opened, the maturity value is indicated to the customer assuming that the monthly installments will be paid regularly on due dates.
            If any installment is delayed, the interest payable in the account will be reduced and will not be sufficient to reach the maturity value.
            Therefore, the difference in interest will be deducted from the maturity value as a penalty. The rate of penalty will be fixed upfront. 
            </p>
